extends VisualShaderNode
#brief Calculates an outer product of two vectors within the visual shader graph.
#desc [code]OuterProduct[/code] treats the first parameter [code]c[/code] as a column vector (matrix with one column) and the second parameter [code]r[/code] as a row vector (matrix with one row) and does a linear algebraic matrix multiply [code]c * r[/code], yielding a matrix whose number of rows is the number of components in [code]c[/code] and whose number of columns is the number of components in [code]r[/code].
