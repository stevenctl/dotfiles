#brief Plugin for adding custom property editors on the inspector.
#desc [EditorInspectorPlugin] allows adding custom property editors to [EditorInspector].
#desc When an object is edited, the [method _can_handle] function is called and must return [code]true[/code] if the object type is supported.
#desc If supported, the function [method _parse_begin] will be called, allowing to place custom controls at the beginning of the class.
#desc Subsequently, the [method _parse_category] and [method _parse_property] are called for every category and property. They offer the ability to add custom controls to the inspector too.
#desc Finally, [method _parse_end] will be called.
#desc On each of these calls, the "add" functions can be called.
#desc To use [EditorInspectorPlugin], register it using the [method EditorPlugin.add_inspector_plugin] method first.
