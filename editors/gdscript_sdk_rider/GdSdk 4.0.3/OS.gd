#brief Operating System functions.
#desc Operating System functions. [OS] wraps the most common functionality to communicate with the host operating system, such as the video driver, delays, environment variables, execution of binaries, command line, etc.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] In Godot 4, [OS] functions related to window management were moved to the [DisplayServer] singleton.

The [param arguments] are used in the given order, separated by spaces, and wrapped in quotes. If an [param output] [Array] is provided, the complete shell output of the process will be appended as a single [String] element in [param output].

#desc If the command is successfully executed, the method will return the exit code of the command, or [code]-1[/code] if it fails.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] The Godot thread will pause its execution until the executed command terminates. Use [Thread] to create a separate thread that will not pause the Godot thread, or use [method create_process] to create a completely independent process.

#desc Returns the command-line arguments passed to the engine.
#desc Command-line arguments can be written in any form, including both [code]--key value[/code] and [code]--key=value[/code] forms so they can be properly parsed, as long as custom command-line arguments do not conflict with engine arguments.
#desc You can also incorporate environment variables using the [method get_environment] method.
#desc You can set [member ProjectSettings.editor/run/main_run_args] to define command-line arguments to be passed by the editor when running the project.

#desc }
#desc }
#desc [/csharp]
#desc [/codeblocks]
#desc [b]Note:[/b] Passing custom user arguments directly is not recommended, as the engine may discard or modify them. Instead, the best way is to use the standard UNIX double dash ([code]--[/code]) and then pass custom arguments, which the engine itself will ignore. These can be read via [method get_cmdline_user_args].
func get_cmdline_args() -> PackedStringArray:

#desc Similar to [method get_cmdline_args], but this returns the user arguments (any argument passed after the double dash [code]--[/code] or double plus [code]++[/code] argument). These are left untouched by Godot for the user. [code]++[/code] can be used in situations where [code]--[/code] is intercepted by another program (such as [code]startx[/code]).
#desc For example, in the command line below, [code]--fullscreen[/code] will not be returned in [method get_cmdline_user_args] and [code]--level 1[/code] will only be returned in [method get_cmdline_user_args]:
#desc [codeblock]

#desc [code]VARIANT[/code] - optional, language variant, region and sort order. Variant can have any number of underscored keywords.
#desc [code]extra[/code] - optional, semicolon separated list of additional key words. Currency, calendar, sort order and numbering system information.
func get_locale() -> String:

#desc Returns the host OS locale's 2 or 3-letter [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes]language code[/url] as a string which should be consistent on all platforms. This is equivalent to extracting the [code]language[/code] part of the [method get_locale] string.
#desc This can be used to narrow down fully specified locale strings to only the "common" language code, when you don't need the additional information about country code or variants. For example, for a French Canadian user with [code]fr_CA[/code] locale, this would return [code]fr[/code].
