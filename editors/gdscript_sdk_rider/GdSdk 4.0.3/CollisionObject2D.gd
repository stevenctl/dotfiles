extends Node2D
#brief Base node for 2D collision objects.
#desc CollisionObject2D is the base class for 2D physics objects. It can hold any number of 2D collision [Shape2D]s. Each shape must be assigned to a [i]shape owner[/i]. The CollisionObject2D can have any number of shape owners. Shape owners are not nodes and do not appear in the editor, but are accessible through code using the [code]shape_owner_*[/code] methods.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] Only collisions between objects within the same canvas ([Viewport] canvas or [CanvasLayer]) are supported. The behavior of collisions between objects in different canvases is undefined.
class_name CollisionObject2D

#desc Emitted when an input event occurs. Requires [member input_pickable] to be [code]true[/code] and at least one [member collision_layer] bit to be set. See [method _input_event] for details.
signal input_event(viewport: Node, event: InputEvent, shape_idx: int)
#desc Emitted when the mouse pointer enters any of this object's shapes. Requires [member input_pickable] to be [code]true[/code] and at least one [member collision_layer] bit to be set. Note that moving between different shapes within a single [CollisionObject2D] won't cause this signal to be emitted.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] Due to the lack of continuous collision detection, this signal may not be emitted in the expected order if the mouse moves fast enough and the [CollisionObject2D]'s area is small. This signal may also not be emitted if another [CollisionObject2D] is overlapping the [CollisionObject2D] in question.
signal mouse_entered
#desc Emitted when the mouse pointer exits all this object's shapes. Requires [member input_pickable] to be [code]true[/code] and at least one [member collision_layer] bit to be set. Note that moving between different shapes within a single [CollisionObject2D] won't cause this signal to be emitted.

signal mouse_exited
#desc Emitted when the mouse pointer enters any of this object's shapes or moves from one shape to another. [param shape_idx] is the child index of the newly entered [Shape2D]. Requires [member input_pickable] to be [code]true[/code] and at least one [member collision_layer] bit to be set.
signal mouse_shape_entered(shape_idx: int)

#desc When [member Node.process_mode] is set to [constant Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED], remove from the physics simulation to stop all physics interactions with this [CollisionObject2D].
#desc Automatically re-added to the physics simulation when the [Node] is processed again.
#desc When [member Node.process_mode] is set to [constant Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED], make the body static. Doesn't affect [Area2D]. [PhysicsBody2D] can't be affected by forces or other bodies while static.
#desc Automatically set [PhysicsBody2D] back to its original mode when the [Node] is processed again.
#desc When [member Node.process_mode] is set to [constant Node.PROCESS_MODE_DISABLED], do not affect the physics simulation.
