#brief Type to handle file reading and writing operations.
#desc File type. This is used to permanently store data into the user device's file system and to read from it. This can be used to store game save data or player configuration files, for example.
#desc Here's a sample on how to write and read from a file:
#desc [codeblocks]
#desc [gdscript]
#desc func save(content):
#desc var file = FileAccess.open("user://save_game.dat", FileAccess.WRITE)
#desc file.store_string(content)
#desc 
#desc func load():
#desc var file = FileAccess.open("user://save_game.dat", FileAccess.READ)
#desc var content = file.get_as_text()
#desc return content
#desc [/gdscript]
#desc [csharp]
#desc public void Save(string content)
#desc {
#desc using var file = FileAccess.Open("user://save_game.dat", FileAccess.ModeFlags.Write);
#desc file.StoreString(content);
#desc }
#desc 
#desc public string Load()
#desc {
#desc using var file = FileAccess.Open("user://save_game.dat", FileAccess.ModeFlags.Read);
#desc string content = file.GetAsText();
#desc return content;
#desc }
#desc [/csharp]
#desc [/codeblocks]
#desc In the example above, the file will be saved in the user data folder as specified in the [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/io/data_paths.html]Data paths[/url] documentation.
#desc [FileAccess] will close when it's freed, which happens when it goes out of scope or when it gets assigned with [code]null[/code]. In C# the reference must be disposed after we are done using it, this can be done with the [code]using[/code] statement or calling the [code]Dispose[/code] method directly.
#desc [codeblocks]
#desc [gdscript]
#desc var file = FileAccess.open("res://something") # File is opened and locked for use.
#desc file = null # File is closed.
#desc [/gdscript]
#desc [csharp]
#desc using var file = FileAccess.Open("res://something"); // File is opened and locked for use.
#desc // The using statement calls Dispose when going out of scope.
#desc [/csharp]
#desc [/codeblocks]
#desc [b]Note:[/b] To access project resources once exported, it is recommended to use [ResourceLoader] instead of the [FileAccess] API, as some files are converted to engine-specific formats and their original source files might not be present in the exported PCK package.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] Files are automatically closed only if the process exits "normally" (such as by clicking the window manager's close button or pressing [b]Alt + F4[/b]). If you stop the project execution by pressing [b]F8[/b] while the project is running, the file won't be closed as the game process will be killed. You can work around this by calling [method flush] at regular intervals.

#desc If [code]true[/code], the file is read with big-endian [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness]endianness[/url]. If [code]false[/code], the file is read with little-endian endianness. If in doubt, leave this to [code]false[/code] as most files are written with little-endian endianness.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] [member big_endian] is only about the file format, not the CPU type. The CPU endianness doesn't affect the default endianness for files written.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] This is always reset to [code]false[/code] whenever you open the file. Therefore, you must set [member big_endian] [i]after[/i] opening the file, not before.

#desc Closes the currently opened file and prevents subsequent read/write operations. Use [method flush] to persist the data to disk without closing the file.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] [FileAccess] will automatically close when it's freed, which happens when it goes out of scope or when it gets assigned with [code]null[/code]. In C# the reference must be disposed after we are done using it, this can be done with the [code]using[/code] statement or calling the [code]Dispose[/code] method directly.

#desc Returns [code]true[/code] if the file cursor has already read past the end of the file.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] [code]eof_reached() == false[/code] cannot be used to check whether there is more data available. To loop while there is more data available, use:
#desc [codeblocks]
#desc [gdscript]
#desc while file.get_position() < file.get_length():
#desc # Read data
#desc [/gdscript]
#desc [csharp]
#desc while (file.GetPosition() < file.GetLength())
#desc {
#desc // Read data
#desc }
#desc [/csharp]
#desc [/codeblocks]
func eof_reached() -> bool:
	pass;

#desc Returns [code]true[/code] if the file exists in the given path.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] Many resources types are imported (e.g. textures or sound files), and their source asset will not be included in the exported game, as only the imported version is used. See [method ResourceLoader.exists] for an alternative approach that takes resource remapping into account.
#desc For a non-static, relative equivalent, use [method DirAccess.file_exists].
static func file_exists(path: String) -> bool:
	pass;

#desc Writes the file's buffer to disk. Flushing is automatically performed when the file is closed. This means you don't need to call [method flush] manually before closing a file. Still, calling [method flush] can be used to ensure the data is safe even if the project crashes instead of being closed gracefully.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] Only call [method flush] when you actually need it. Otherwise, it will decrease performance due to constant disk writes.
func flush() -> void:
	pass;

#desc Returns the next 16 bits from the file as an integer. See [method store_16] for details on what values can be stored and retrieved this way.
func get_16() -> int:
	pass;

#desc Returns the next 32 bits from the file as an integer. See [method store_32] for details on what values can be stored and retrieved this way.

#desc Returns the whole file as a [String]. Text is interpreted as being UTF-8 encoded.
#desc If [param skip_cr] is [code]true[/code], carriage return characters ([code]\r[/code], CR) will be ignored when parsing the UTF-8, so that only line feed characters ([code]\n[/code], LF) represent a new line (Unix convention).

#desc Returns next [param length] bytes of the file as a [PackedByteArray].

#desc Returns the next value of the file in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format. You can pass a different delimiter [param delim] to use other than the default [code]","[/code] (comma). This delimiter must be one-character long, and cannot be a double quotation mark.
#desc Text is interpreted as being UTF-8 encoded. Text values must be enclosed in double quotes if they include the delimiter character. Double quotes within a text value can be escaped by doubling their occurrence.
#desc For example, the following CSV lines are valid and will be properly parsed as two strings each:
#desc [codeblock]
#desc Alice,"Hello, Bob!"
#desc Bob,Alice! What a surprise!
#desc Alice,"I thought you'd reply with ""Hello, world""."
#desc [/codeblock]
#desc Note how the second line can omit the enclosing quotes as it does not include the delimiter. However it [i]could[/i] very well use quotes, it was only written without for demonstration purposes. The third line must use [code]""[/code] for each quotation mark that needs to be interpreted as such instead of the end of a text value.
func get_csv_line(delim: String = ",") -> PackedStringArray:
	pass;

#desc Returns the next 64 bits from the file as a floating-point number.
func get_double() -> float:
	pass;

#desc Returns the last error that happened when trying to perform operations. Compare with the [code]ERR_FILE_*[/code] constants from [enum Error].

static func get_sha256(path: String) -> String:
	pass;

#desc Returns the next [Variant] value from the file. If [param allow_objects] is [code]true[/code], decoding objects is allowed.
#desc Internally, this uses the same decoding mechanism as the [method @GlobalScope.bytes_to_var] method.
#desc [b]Warning:[/b] Deserialized objects can contain code which gets executed. Do not use this option if the serialized object comes from untrusted sources to avoid potential security threats such as remote code execution.
func get_var(allow_objects: bool = false) -> Variant:

#desc Returns [code]true[/code] if the file is currently opened.
func is_open() -> bool:
	pass;

#desc Creates a new [FileAccess] object and opens the file for writing or reading, depending on the flags.
#desc Returns [code]null[/code] if opening the file failed. You can use [method get_open_error] to check the error that occurred.
static func open(path: String, flags: int) -> FileAccess:
	pass;

#desc Creates a new [FileAccess] object and opens a compressed file for reading or writing.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] [method open_compressed] can only read files that were saved by Godot, not third-party compression formats. See [url=https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/28999]GitHub issue #28999[/url] for a workaround.

The string is stored as a UTF-8 encoded buffer without string length or terminating zero, which means that it can't be loaded back easily. If you want to store a retrievable string in a binary file, consider using [method store_pascal_string] instead. For retrieving strings from a text file, you can use [code]get_buffer(length).get_string_from_utf8()[/code] (if you know the length) or [method get_as_text].

#desc [b]Note:[/b] Not all properties are included. Only properties that are configured with the [constant PROPERTY_USAGE_STORAGE] flag set will be serialized. You can add a new usage flag to a property by overriding the [method Object._get_property_list] method in your class. You can also check how property usage is configured by calling [method Object._get_property_list]. See [enum PropertyUsageFlags] for the possible usage flags.
