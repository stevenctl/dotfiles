extends SkeletonModification2D
#brief A modification that applies the transforms of [PhysicalBone2D] nodes to [Bone2D] nodes.
#desc This modification takes the transforms of [PhysicalBone2D] nodes and applies them to [Bone2D] nodes. This allows the [Bone2D] nodes to react to physics thanks to the linked [PhysicalBone2D] nodes.
#desc Experimental. Physical bones may be changed in the future to perform the position update of [Bone2D] on their own.
