#brief Helper node to calculate generic geometry operations in 2D space.
#desc Geometry2D provides users with a set of helper functions to create geometric shapes, compute intersections between shapes, and process various other geometric operations.
class_name Geometry2D

#desc Create regions where either subject or clip polygons (or both) are filled.
#desc Create regions where subject polygons are filled except where clip polygons are filled.
#desc Create regions where both subject and clip polygons are filled.
#desc Create regions where either subject or clip polygons are filled but not where both are filled.
#desc Squaring is applied uniformally at all convex edge joins at [code]1 * delta[/code].
#desc While flattened paths can never perfectly trace an arc, they are approximated by a series of arc chords.
#desc There's a necessary limit to mitered joins since offsetting edges that join at very acute angles will produce excessively long and narrow "spikes". For any given edge join, when miter offsetting would exceed that maximum distance, "square" joining is applied.
#desc Endpoints are joined using the [enum PolyJoinType] value and the path filled as a polygon.
#desc Endpoints are joined using the [enum PolyJoinType] value and the path filled as a polyline.
#desc Endpoints are squared off with no extension.
#desc Endpoints are squared off and extended by [code]delta[/code] units.
#desc Endpoints are rounded off and extended by [code]delta[/code] units.
