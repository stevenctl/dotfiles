#brief Abstract base class for the game's main loop.
#desc [MainLoop] is the abstract base class for a Godot project's game loop. It is inherited by [SceneTree], which is the default game loop implementation used in Godot projects, though it is also possible to write and use one's own [MainLoop] subclass instead of the scene tree.
#desc Upon the application start, a [MainLoop] implementation must be provided to the OS; otherwise, the application will exit. This happens automatically (and a [SceneTree] is created) unless a [MainLoop] [Script] is provided from the command line (with e.g. [code]godot -s my_loop.gd[/code] or the "Main Loop Type" project setting is overwritten.
#desc Here is an example script implementing a simple [MainLoop]:
