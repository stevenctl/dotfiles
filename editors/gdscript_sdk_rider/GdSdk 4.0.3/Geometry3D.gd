#brief Helper node to calculate generic geometry operations in 3D space.
#desc Geometry3D provides users with a set of helper functions to create geometric shapes, compute intersections between shapes, and process various other geometric operations.
class_name Geometry3D




#desc Returns an array with 6 [Plane]s that describe the sides of a box centered at the origin. The box size is defined by [param extents], which represents one (positive) corner of the box (i.e. half its actual size).
func build_box_planes(extents: Vector3) -> Array[Plane]:
	pass;

#desc Returns an array of [Plane]s closely bounding a faceted capsule centered at the origin with radius [param radius] and height [param height]. The parameter [param sides] defines how many planes will be generated for the side part of the capsule, whereas [param lats] gives the number of latitudinal steps at the bottom and top of the capsule. The parameter [param axis] describes the axis along which the capsule is oriented (0 for X, 1 for Y, 2 for Z).
func build_capsule_planes(radius: float, height: float, sides: int, lats: int, axis: int = 2) -> Array[Plane]:
	pass;

#desc Returns an array of [Plane]s closely bounding a faceted cylinder centered at the origin with radius [param radius] and height [param height]. The parameter [param sides] defines how many planes will be generated for the round part of the cylinder. The parameter [param axis] describes the axis along which the cylinder is oriented (0 for X, 1 for Y, 2 for Z).
func build_cylinder_planes(radius: float, height: float, sides: int, axis: int = 2) -> Array[Plane]:
	pass;

#desc Clips the polygon defined by the points in [param points] against the [param plane] and returns the points of the clipped polygon.
func clip_polygon(points: PackedVector3Array, plane: Plane) -> PackedVector3Array:
	pass;

#desc Returns the 3D point on the 3D segment ([param s1], [param s2]) that is closest to [param point]. The returned point will always be inside the specified segment.
func get_closest_point_to_segment(point: Vector3, s1: Vector3, s2: Vector3) -> Vector3:
	pass;

#desc Returns the 3D point on the 3D line defined by ([param s1], [param s2]) that is closest to [param point]. The returned point can be inside the segment ([param s1], [param s2]) or outside of it, i.e. somewhere on the line extending from the segment.
func get_closest_point_to_segment_uncapped(point: Vector3, s1: Vector3, s2: Vector3) -> Vector3:
	pass;

#desc Given the two 3D segments ([param p1], [param p2]) and ([param q1], [param q2]), finds those two points on the two segments that are closest to each other. Returns a [PackedVector3Array] that contains this point on ([param p1], [param p2]) as well the accompanying point on ([param q1], [param q2]).
func get_closest_points_between_segments(p1: Vector3, p2: Vector3, q1: Vector3, q2: Vector3) -> PackedVector3Array:
	pass;

#desc Tests if the 3D ray starting at [param from] with the direction of [param dir] intersects the triangle specified by [param a], [param b] and [param c]. If yes, returns the point of intersection as [Vector3]. If no intersection takes place, returns [code]null[/code].
func ray_intersects_triangle(from: Vector3, dir: Vector3, a: Vector3, b: Vector3, c: Vector3) -> Variant:
	pass;

#desc Given a convex hull defined though the [Plane]s in the array [param planes], tests if the segment ([param from], [param to]) intersects with that hull. If an intersection is found, returns a [PackedVector3Array] containing the point the intersection and the hull's normal. Otherwise, returns an empty array.
func segment_intersects_convex(from: Vector3, to: Vector3, planes: Array) -> PackedVector3Array:
	pass;

#desc Checks if the segment ([param from], [param to]) intersects the cylinder with height [param height] that is centered at the origin and has radius [param radius]. If no, returns an empty [PackedVector3Array]. If an intersection takes place, the returned array contains the point of intersection and the cylinder's normal at the point of intersection.
func segment_intersects_cylinder(from: Vector3, to: Vector3, height: float, radius: float) -> PackedVector3Array:
	pass;

#desc Checks if the segment ([param from], [param to]) intersects the sphere that is located at [param sphere_position] and has radius [param sphere_radius]. If no, returns an empty [PackedVector3Array]. If yes, returns a [PackedVector3Array] containing the point of intersection and the sphere's normal at the point of intersection.
func segment_intersects_sphere(from: Vector3, to: Vector3, sphere_position: Vector3, sphere_radius: float) -> PackedVector3Array:
	pass;

#desc Tests if the segment ([param from], [param to]) intersects the triangle [param a], [param b], [param c]. If yes, returns the point of intersection as [Vector3]. If no intersection takes place, returns [code]null[/code].
