#brief 2D axis-aligned bounding box using integer coordinates.
#desc [Rect2i] consists of a position, a size, and several utility functions. It is typically used for fast overlap tests.
#desc It uses integer coordinates. If you need floating-point coordinates, use [Rect2] instead.
#desc Negative values for [member size] are not supported and will not work for most methods. Use [method abs] to get a Rect2i with a positive size.

#desc Ending corner. This is calculated as [code]position + size[/code]. Setting this value will change the size.
var end: Vector2i

#desc Beginning corner. Typically has values lower than [member end].
var position: Vector2i

#desc Size from [member position] to [member end]. Typically, all components are positive.
#desc If the size is negative, you can use [method abs] to fix it.
var size: Vector2i
