extends Node2D
#brief Overrides the location sounds are heard from.
#desc Once added to the scene tree and enabled using [method make_current], this node will override the location sounds are heard from. Only one [AudioListener2D] can be current. Using [method make_current] will disable the previous [AudioListener2D].
#desc If there is no active [AudioListener2D] in the current [Viewport], center of the screen will be used as a hearing point for the audio. [AudioListener2D] needs to be inside [SceneTree] to function.
