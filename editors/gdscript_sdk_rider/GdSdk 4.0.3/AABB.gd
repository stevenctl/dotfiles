#brief Axis-Aligned Bounding Box.
#desc [AABB] consists of a position, a size, and several utility functions. It is typically used for fast overlap tests.
#desc It uses floating-point coordinates. The 2D counterpart to [AABB] is [Rect2].
#desc Negative values for [member size] are not supported and will not work for most methods. Use [method abs] to get an AABB with a positive size.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] Unlike [Rect2], [AABB] does not have a variant that uses integer coordinates.

#desc Ending corner. This is calculated as [code]position + size[/code]. Setting this value will change the size.
var end: Vector3

#desc Beginning corner. Typically has values lower than [member end].
var position: Vector3

#desc Size from [member position] to [member end]. Typically, all components are positive.
#desc If the size is negative, you can use [method abs] to fix it.
var size: Vector3

func AABB() -> AABB:
	pass;

#desc Constructs an [AABB] as a copy of the given [AABB].

	pass;

#desc Constructs an [AABB] from a position and size.
func AABB(position: Vector3, size: Vector3) -> AABB:
	pass;


#desc Returns an AABB with equivalent position and size, modified so that the most-negative corner is the origin and the size is positive.

#desc Returns [code]true[/code] if this [AABB] completely encloses another one.
func encloses(with: AABB) -> bool:
