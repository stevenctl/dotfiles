#brief Image datatype.
#desc Native image datatype. Contains image data which can be converted to an [ImageTexture] and provides commonly used [i]image processing[/i] methods. The maximum width and height for an [Image] are [constant MAX_WIDTH] and [constant MAX_HEIGHT].
#desc An [Image] cannot be assigned to a [code]texture[/code] property of an object directly (such as [Sprite2D]), and has to be converted manually to an [ImageTexture] first.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] The maximum image size is 16384Ã—16384 pixels due to graphics hardware limitations. Larger images may fail to import.
