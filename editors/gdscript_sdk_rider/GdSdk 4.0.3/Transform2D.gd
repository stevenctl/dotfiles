#brief 2D transformation (2×3 matrix).
#desc 2×3 matrix (2 rows, 3 columns) used for 2D linear transformations. It can represent transformations such as translation, rotation, or scaling. It consists of three [Vector2] values: [member x], [member y], and the [member origin].
#desc For more information, read the "Matrices and transforms" documentation article.
