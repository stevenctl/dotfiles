#brief Lightweight object used for general-purpose animation via script, using [Tweener]s.
#desc Tweens are mostly useful for animations requiring a numerical property to be interpolated over a range of values. The name [i]tween[/i] comes from [i]in-betweening[/i], an animation technique where you specify [i]keyframes[/i] and the computer interpolates the frames that appear between them. Animating something with a [Tween] is called tweening.
#desc [Tween] is more suited than [AnimationPlayer] for animations where you don't know the final values in advance. For example, interpolating a dynamically-chosen camera zoom value is best done with a [Tween]; it would be difficult to do the same thing with an [AnimationPlayer] node. Tweens are also more light-weight than [AnimationPlayer], so they are very much suited for simple animations or general tasks that don't require visual tweaking provided by the editor. They can be used in a fire-and-forget manner for some logic that normally would be done by code. You can e.g. make something shoot periodically by using a looped [CallbackTweener] with a delay.
#desc A [Tween] can be created by using either [method SceneTree.create_tween] or [method Node.create_tween]. [Tween]s created manually (i.e. by using [code]Tween.new()[/code]) are invalid and can't be used for tweening values.
#desc A tween animation is created by adding [Tweener]s to the [Tween] object, using [method tween_property], [method tween_interval], [method tween_callback] or [method tween_method]:
#desc [codeblocks]
#desc [gdscript]
#desc var tween = get_tree().create_tween()
#desc tween.tween_property($Sprite, "modulate", Color.RED, 1)
#desc tween.tween_property($Sprite, "scale", Vector2(), 1)
#desc tween.tween_callback($Sprite.queue_free)
#desc [/gdscript]
#desc [csharp]
#desc Tween tween = GetTree().CreateTween();
#desc tween.TweenProperty(GetNode("Sprite"), "modulate", Colors.Red, 1.0f);
#desc tween.TweenProperty(GetNode("Sprite"), "scale", Vector2.Zero, 1.0f);
#desc tween.TweenCallback(Callable.From(GetNode("Sprite").QueueFree));
#desc [/csharp]
#desc [/codeblocks]
#desc This sequence will make the [code]$Sprite[/code] node turn red, then shrink, before finally calling [method Node.queue_free] to free the sprite. [Tweener]s are executed one after another by default. This behavior can be changed using [method parallel] and [method set_parallel].
#desc When a [Tweener] is created with one of the [code]tween_*[/code] methods, a chained method call can be used to tweak the properties of this [Tweener]. For example, if you want to set a different transition type in the above example, you can use [method set_trans]:
#desc [codeblocks]
#desc [gdscript]
#desc var tween = get_tree().create_tween()
#desc tween.tween_property($Sprite, "modulate", Color.RED, 1).set_trans(Tween.TRANS_SINE)
#desc tween.tween_property($Sprite, "scale", Vector2(), 1).set_trans(Tween.TRANS_BOUNCE)
#desc tween.tween_callback($Sprite.queue_free)
#desc [/gdscript]
#desc [csharp]
#desc Tween tween = GetTree().CreateTween();
#desc tween.TweenProperty(GetNode("Sprite"), "modulate", Colors.Red, 1.0f).SetTrans(Tween.TransitionType.Sine);
#desc tween.TweenProperty(GetNode("Sprite"), "scale", Vector2.Zero, 1.0f).SetTrans(Tween.TransitionType.Bounce);
#desc tween.TweenCallback(Callable.From(GetNode("Sprite").QueueFree));
#desc [/csharp]
#desc [/codeblocks]
#desc Most of the [Tween] methods can be chained this way too. In the following example the [Tween] is bound to the running script's node and a default transition is set for its [Tweener]s:
#desc [codeblocks]
#desc [gdscript]
#desc var tween = get_tree().create_tween().bind_node(self).set_trans(Tween.TRANS_ELASTIC)
#desc tween.tween_property($Sprite, "modulate", Color.RED, 1)
#desc tween.tween_property($Sprite, "scale", Vector2(), 1)
#desc tween.tween_callback($Sprite.queue_free)
#desc [/gdscript]
#desc [csharp]
#desc var tween = GetTree().CreateTween().BindNode(this).SetTrans(Tween.TransitionType.Elastic);
#desc tween.TweenProperty(GetNode("Sprite"), "modulate", Colors.Red, 1.0f);
#desc tween.TweenProperty(GetNode("Sprite"), "scale", Vector2.Zero, 1.0f);
#desc tween.TweenCallback(Callable.From(GetNode("Sprite").QueueFree));
#desc [/csharp]
#desc [/codeblocks]
#desc Another interesting use for [Tween]s is animating arbitrary sets of objects:
#desc [codeblocks]
#desc [gdscript]
#desc var tween = create_tween()
#desc for sprite in get_children():
#desc tween.tween_property(sprite, "position", Vector2(0, 0), 1)
#desc [/gdscript]
#desc [csharp]
#desc Tween tween = CreateTween();
#desc foreach (Node sprite in GetChildren())
#desc tween.TweenProperty(sprite, "position", Vector2.Zero, 1.0f);
#desc [/csharp]
#desc [/codeblocks]
#desc In the example above, all children of a node are moved one after another to position (0, 0).
#desc You should avoid using more than one [Tween] per object's property. If two or more tweens animate one property at the same time, the last one created will take priority and assign the final value. If you want to interrupt and restart an animation, consider assigning the [Tween] to a variable:
#desc [codeblocks]
#desc [gdscript]
#desc var tween
#desc func animate():
#desc if tween:
#desc tween.kill() # Abort the previous animation.
#desc tween = create_tween()
#desc [/gdscript]
#desc [csharp]
#desc private Tween _tween;
#desc 
#desc public void Animate()
#desc {
#desc if (_tween != null)
#desc _tween.Kill(); // Abort the previous animation
#desc _tween = CreateTween();
#desc }
#desc [/csharp]
#desc [/codeblocks]
#desc Some [Tweener]s use transitions and eases. The first accepts a [enum TransitionType] constant, and refers to the way the timing of the animation is handled (see [url=https://easings.net/]easings.net[/url] for some examples). The second accepts an [enum EaseType] constant, and controls where the [code]trans_type[/code] is applied to the interpolation (in the beginning, the end, or both). If you don't know which transition and easing to pick, you can try different [enum TransitionType] constants with [constant EASE_IN_OUT], and use the one that looks best.

#desc [b]Note:[/b] Tweens are not designed to be re-used and trying to do so results in an undefined behavior. Create a new Tween for each animation and every time you replay an animation from start. Keep in mind that Tweens start immediately, so only create a Tween when you want to start animating.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] Tweens are processing after all of nodes in the current frame, i.e. after [method Node._process] or [method Node._physics_process] (depending on [enum TweenProcessMode]).
class_name Tween

#desc Emitted when the [Tween] has finished all tweening. Never emitted when the [Tween] is set to infinite looping (see [method set_loops]).

#desc Emitted when a full loop is complete (see [method set_loops]), providing the loop index. This signal is not emitted after the final loop, use [signal finished] instead for this case.
signal loop_finished(loop_count: int)
#desc Emitted when one step of the [Tween] is complete, providing the step index. One step is either a single [Tweener] or a group of [Tweener]s running in parallel.

#desc The [Tween] updates during the physics frame.
#desc The [Tween] updates during the idle frame.
#desc If the [Tween] has a bound node, it will process when that node can process (see [member Node.process_mode]). Otherwise it's the same as [constant TWEEN_PAUSE_STOP].
#desc If [SceneTree] is paused, the [Tween] will also pause.
#desc The [Tween] will process regardless of whether [SceneTree] is paused.

#desc The animation is interpolated with a quadratic (to the power of 2) function.
#desc The animation is interpolated with an exponential (to the power of x) function.

#desc Binds this [Tween] with the given [param node]. [Tween]s are processed directly by the [SceneTree], so they run independently of the animated nodes.
