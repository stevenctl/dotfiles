#brief Helper tool to create geometry.
#desc The [SurfaceTool] is used to construct a [Mesh] by specifying vertex attributes individually. It can be used to construct a [Mesh] from a script. All properties except indices need to be added before calling [method add_vertex]. For example, to add vertex colors and UVs:
#desc [codeblocks]
#desc [gdscript]
#desc var st = SurfaceTool.new()
#desc st.begin(Mesh.PRIMITIVE_TRIANGLES)
#desc st.set_color(Color(1, 0, 0))
#desc st.set_uv(Vector2(0, 0))
#desc st.add_vertex(Vector3(0, 0, 0))
#desc [/gdscript]
#desc [csharp]
#desc var st = new SurfaceTool();
#desc st.Begin(Mesh.PrimitiveType.Triangles);
#desc st.SetColor(new Color(1, 0, 0));
#desc st.SetUv(new Vector2(0, 0));
#desc st.AddVertex(new Vector3(0, 0, 0));
#desc [/csharp]
#desc [/codeblocks]
#desc The above [SurfaceTool] now contains one vertex of a triangle which has a UV coordinate and a specified [Color]. If another vertex were added without calling [method set_uv] or [method set_color], then the last values would be used.
#desc Vertex attributes must be passed [b]before[/b] calling [method add_vertex]. Failure to do so will result in an error when committing the vertex information to a mesh.
#desc Additionally, the attributes used before the first vertex is added determine the format of the mesh. For example, if you only add UVs to the first vertex, you cannot add color to any of the subsequent vertices.
#desc See also [ArrayMesh], [ImmediateMesh] and [MeshDataTool] for procedural geometry generation.
