#brief A spatial node that has its position automatically updated by the [XRServer].
#desc This node can be bound to a specific pose of a [XRPositionalTracker] and will automatically have its [member Node3D.transform] updated by the [XRServer]. Nodes of this type must be added as children of the [XROrigin3D] node.
