#brief Godot editor's interface.
#desc EditorInterface gives you control over Godot editor's window. It allows customizing the window, saving and (re-)loading scenes, rendering mesh previews, inspecting and editing resources and objects, and provides access to [EditorSettings], [EditorFileSystem], [EditorResourcePreview], [ScriptEditor], the editor viewport, and information about scenes.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the singleton using [method EditorPlugin.get_editor_interface].
