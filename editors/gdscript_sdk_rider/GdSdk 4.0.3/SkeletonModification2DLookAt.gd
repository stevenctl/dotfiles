extends SkeletonModification2D
#brief A modification that rotates a [Bone2D] node to look at a target.
#desc This [SkeletonModification2D] rotates a bone to look a target. This is extremely helpful for moving character's head to look at the player, rotating a turret to look at a target, or any other case where you want to make a bone rotate towards something quickly and easily.
class_name SkeletonModification2DLookAt


#desc The [Bone2D] node that the modification will operate on.
var bone2d_node: NodePath:
	get = get_bone2d_node, set = set_bone2d_node

#desc The index of the [Bone2D] node that the modification will operate on.
var bone_index: int:
	get = get_bone_index, set = set_bone_index

#desc The NodePath to the node that is the target for the LookAt modification. This node is what the modification will rotate the [Bone2D] to.

	get = get_target_node, set = set_target_node

#desc An inverted joint constraint only constraints the [Bone2D] to the angles [i]outside of[/i] the inputted minimum and maximum angles. For this reason, it is referred to as an inverted joint constraint, as it constraints the joint to the outside of the inputted values.
