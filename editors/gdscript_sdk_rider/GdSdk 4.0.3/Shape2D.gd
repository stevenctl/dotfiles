#desc The shape's custom solver bias. Defines how much bodies react to enforce contact separation when this shape is involved.
#desc When set to [code]0[/code], the default value from [member ProjectSettings.physics/2d/solver/default_contact_bias] is used.

#desc Returns [code]true[/code] if this shape is colliding with another.
#desc This method needs the transformation matrix for this shape ([param local_xform]), the shape to check collisions with ([param with_shape]), and the transformation matrix of that shape ([param shape_xform]).

#desc If there are no collisions, the returned list is empty. Otherwise, the returned list contains contact points arranged in pairs, with entries alternating between points on the boundary of this shape and points on the boundary of [param with_shape].
#desc A collision pair A, B can be used to calculate the collision normal with [code](B - A).normalized()[/code], and the collision depth with [code](B - A).length()[/code]. This information is typically used to separate shapes, particularly in collision solvers.
