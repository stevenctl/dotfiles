extends Object
#brief Singleton that connects the engine with the browser's JavaScript context in Web export.
#desc The JavaScriptBridge singleton is implemented only in the Web export. It's used to access the browser's JavaScript context. This allows interaction with embedding pages or calling third-party JavaScript APIs.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] This singleton can be disabled at build-time to improve security. By default, the JavaScriptBridge singleton is enabled. Official export templates also have the JavaScriptBridge singleton enabled. See [url=$DOCS_URL/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_for_web.html]Compiling for the Web[/url] in the documentation for more information.

#desc Prompts the user to download a file containing the specified [param buffer]. The file will have the given [param name] and [param mime] type.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] The browser may override the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type]MIME type[/url] provided based on the file [param name]'s extension.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] Browsers might block the download if [method download_buffer] is not being called from a user interaction (e.g. button click).
