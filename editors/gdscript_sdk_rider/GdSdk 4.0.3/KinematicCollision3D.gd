#brief Collision data for [method PhysicsBody3D.move_and_collide] collisions.
#desc Contains collision data for [method PhysicsBody3D.move_and_collide] collisions. When a [PhysicsBody3D] is moved using [method PhysicsBody3D.move_and_collide], it stops if it detects a collision with another body. If a collision is detected, a [KinematicCollision3D] object is returned.
#desc This object contains information about the collision, including the colliding object, the remaining motion, and the collision position. This information can be used to calculate a collision response.
class_name KinematicCollision3D




#desc Returns the collision angle according to [param up_direction], which is [constant Vector3.UP] by default. This value is always positive.

#desc Returns the point of collision in global coordinates given a collision index (the deepest collision by default).
