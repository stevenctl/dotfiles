#brief Pre-parsed scene tree path.
#desc A pre-parsed relative or absolute path in a scene tree, for use with [method Node.get_node] and similar functions. It can reference a node, a resource within a node, or a property of a node or resource. For example, [code]"Path2D/PathFollow2D/Sprite2D:texture:size"[/code] would refer to the [code]size[/code] property of the [code]texture[/code] resource on the node named [code]"Sprite2D"[/code] which is a child of the other named nodes in the path.
#desc You will usually just pass a string to [method Node.get_node] and it will be automatically converted, but you may occasionally want to parse a path ahead of time with [NodePath] or the literal syntax [code]^"path"[/code]. Exporting a [NodePath] variable will give you a node selection widget in the properties panel of the editor, which can often be useful.
#desc A [NodePath] is composed of a list of slash-separated node names (like a filesystem path) and an optional colon-separated list of "subnames" which can be resources or properties.
#desc Some examples of NodePaths include the following:
#desc [codeblock]
#desc # No leading slash means it is relative to the current node.
#desc ^"A" # Immediate child A
#desc ^"A/B" # A's child B
#desc ^"." # The current node.
#desc ^".." # The parent node.
#desc ^"../C" # A sibling node C.
#desc # A leading slash means it is absolute from the SceneTree.
#desc ^"/root" # Equivalent to get_tree().get_root().
#desc ^"/root/Main" # If your main scene's root node were named "Main".
#desc ^"/root/MyAutoload" # If you have an autoloaded node or scene.
#desc [/codeblock]
#desc See also [StringName], which is a similar concept for general-purpose string interning.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] In the editor, [NodePath] properties are automatically updated when moving, renaming or deleting a node in the scene tree, but they are never updated at runtime.

class_name NodePath



#desc Constructs an empty [NodePath].
func NodePath() -> NodePath:
	pass;

#desc Constructs a [NodePath] as a copy of the given [NodePath]. [code]NodePath("example")[/code] is equivalent to [code]^"example"[/code].
func NodePath(from: NodePath) -> NodePath:
	pass;

#desc Creates a NodePath from a string, e.g. [code]"Path2D/PathFollow2D/Sprite2D:texture:size"[/code]. A path is absolute if it starts with a slash. Absolute paths are only valid in the global scene tree, not within individual scenes. In a relative path, [code]"."[/code] and [code]".."[/code] indicate the current node and its parent.
#desc The "subnames" optionally included after the path to the target node can point to resources or properties, and can also be nested.
#desc Examples of valid NodePaths (assuming that those nodes exist and have the referenced resources or properties):
#desc [codeblock]
#desc # Points to the Sprite2D node.
#desc "Path2D/PathFollow2D/Sprite2D"
#desc # Points to the Sprite2D node and its "texture" resource.
#desc # get_node() would retrieve "Sprite2D", while get_node_and_resource()
#desc # would retrieve both the Sprite2D node and the "texture" resource.
#desc "Path2D/PathFollow2D/Sprite2D:texture"
#desc # Points to the Sprite2D node and its "position" property.
#desc "Path2D/PathFollow2D/Sprite2D:position"
#desc # Points to the Sprite2D node and the "x" component of its "position" property.
#desc "Path2D/PathFollow2D/Sprite2D:position:x"
#desc # Absolute path (from "root")
#desc "/root/Level/Path2D"
#desc [/codeblock]
