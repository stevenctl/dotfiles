#brief Boolean built-in type.
#desc Boolean is a built-in type. There are two boolean values: [code]true[/code] and [code]false[/code]. You can think of it as a switch with on or off (1 or 0) setting. Booleans are used in programming for logic in condition statements, like [code]if[/code] statements.
#desc Booleans can be directly used in [code]if[/code] statements. The code below demonstrates this on the [code]if can_shoot:[/code] line. You don't need to use [code]== true[/code], you only need [code]if can_shoot:[/code]. Similarly, use [code]if not can_shoot:[/code] rather than [code]== false[/code].
#desc [codeblocks]

#desc var _can_shoot = true
#desc 
#desc func shoot():
#desc if _can_shoot:
#desc pass # Perform shooting actions here.

#desc The following code will only create a bullet if both conditions are met: action "shoot" is pressed and if [code]can_shoot[/code] is [code]true[/code].
#desc [b]Note:[/b] [code]Input.is_action_pressed("shoot")[/code] is also a boolean that is [code]true[/code] when "shoot" is pressed and [code]false[/code] when "shoot" isn't pressed.

#desc The following code will set [code]can_shoot[/code] to [code]false[/code] and start a timer. This will prevent player from shooting until the timer runs out. Next [code]can_shoot[/code] will be set to [code]true[/code] again allowing player to shoot once again.
