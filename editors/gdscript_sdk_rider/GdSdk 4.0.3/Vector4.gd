#brief Vector used for 4D math using floating point coordinates.
#desc 4-element structure that can be used to represent any quadruplet of numeric values.
#desc It uses floating-point coordinates. By default, these floating-point values use 32-bit precision, unlike [float] which is always 64-bit. If double precision is needed, compile the engine with the option [code]precision=double[/code].
#desc See [Vector4i] for its integer counterpart.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] In a boolean context, a Vector4 will evaluate to [code]false[/code] if it's equal to [code]Vector4(0, 0, 0, 0)[/code]. Otherwise, a Vector4 will always evaluate to [code]true[/code].
