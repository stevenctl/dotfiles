#brief AStar class representation that uses 2D vectors as edges.
#desc This is a wrapper for the [AStar3D] class which uses 2D vectors instead of 3D vectors.
class_name AStar2D




#desc Called when computing the cost between two connected points.
#desc Note that this function is hidden in the default [code]AStar2D[/code] class.

#desc Called when estimating the cost between a point and the path's ending point.
#desc Note that this function is hidden in the default [code]AStar2D[/code] class.
func _estimate_cost(from_id: int, to_id: int) -> float:
	pass;

#desc Adds a new point at the given position with the given identifier. The [param id] must be 0 or larger, and the [param weight_scale] must be 0.0 or greater.
#desc The [param weight_scale] is multiplied by the result of [method _compute_cost] when determining the overall cost of traveling across a segment from a neighboring point to this point. Thus, all else being equal, the algorithm prefers points with lower [param weight_scale]s to form a path.
