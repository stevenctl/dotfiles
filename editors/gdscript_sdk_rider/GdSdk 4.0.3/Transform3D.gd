#brief 3D transformation (3×4 matrix).
#desc 3×4 matrix (3 rows, 4 columns) used for 3D linear transformations. It can represent transformations such as translation, rotation, or scaling. It consists of a [member basis] (first 3 columns) and a [Vector3] for the [member origin] (last column).
#desc For more information, read the "Matrices and transforms" documentation article.
