#brief Resource filesystem, as the editor sees it.

#desc Emitted if the filesystem changed.

#desc Emitted if a resource is reimported.

#desc Emitted if at least one resource is reloaded when the filesystem is scanned.

#desc Emitted when the list of global script classes gets updated.

#desc Emitted if the source of any imported file changed.

#desc Reimports a set of files. Call this if these files or their [code].import[/code] files were directly edited by script or an external program.
#desc If the file type changed or the file was newly created, use [method update_file] or [method scan].
#desc [b]Note:[/b] This function blocks until the import is finished. However, the main loop iteration, including timers and [method Node._process], will occur during the import process due to progress bar updates. Avoid calls to [method reimport_files] or [method scan] while an import is in progress.

#desc Add a file in an existing directory, or schedule file information to be updated on editor restart. Can be used to update text files saved by an external program.
#desc This will not import the file. To reimport, call [method reimport_files] or [method scan] methods.
