#brief Abstraction and base class for packet-based protocols.
#desc PacketPeer is an abstraction and base class for packet-based protocols (such as UDP). It provides an API for sending and receiving packets both as raw data or variables. This makes it easy to transfer data over a protocol, without having to encode data as low-level bytes or having to worry about network ordering.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the [code]INTERNET[/code] permission in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by Android.
class_name PacketPeer


#desc Maximum buffer size allowed when encoding [Variant]s. Raise this value to support heavier memory allocations.
#desc The [method put_var] method allocates memory on the stack, and the buffer used will grow automatically to the closest power of two to match the size of the [Variant]. If the [Variant] is bigger than [code]encode_buffer_max_size[/code], the method will error out with [constant ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY].
