#brief 2D axis-aligned bounding box using floating point coordinates.
#desc [Rect2] consists of a position, a size, and several utility functions. It is typically used for fast overlap tests.
#desc It uses floating-point coordinates. If you need integer coordinates, use [Rect2i] instead.
#desc The 3D counterpart to [Rect2] is [AABB].
#desc Negative values for [member size] are not supported and will not work for most methods. Use [method abs] to get a Rect2 with a positive size.

class_name Rect2


#desc Ending corner. This is calculated as [code]position + size[/code]. Setting this value will change the size.
var end: Vector2

#desc Beginning corner. Typically has values lower than [member end].
var position: Vector2

#desc Size from [member position] to [member end]. Typically, all components are positive.
#desc If the size is negative, you can use [method abs] to fix it.
var size: Vector2

#desc # position (-3, 2), size (1, 1)
#desc var rect = Rect2(Vector2(-3, 2), Vector2(1, 1))
