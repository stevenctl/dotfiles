extends Resource
#brief A resource that holds a stack of [SkeletonModification2D]s.
#desc This resource is used by the Skeleton and holds a stack of [SkeletonModification2D]s.
#desc This controls the order of the modifications and how they are applied. Modification order is especially important for full-body IK setups, as you need to execute the modifications in the correct order to get the desired results. For example, you want to execute a modification on the spine [i]before[/i] the arms on a humanoid skeleton.
#desc This resource also controls how strongly all of the modifications are applied to the [Skeleton2D].
class_name SkeletonModificationStack2D


#desc If [code]true[/code], the modification's in the stack will be called. This is handled automatically through the [Skeleton2D] node.
var enabled: bool:
	get = get_enabled, set = set_enabled

#desc The number of modifications in the stack.
var modification_count: int:
	get = get_modification_count, set = set_modification_count

#desc The interpolation strength of the modifications in stack. A value of [code]0[/code] will make it where the modifications are not applied, a strength of [code]0.5[/code] will be half applied, and a strength of [code]1[/code] will allow the modifications to be fully applied and override the [Skeleton2D] [Bone2D] poses.
var strength: float:
	get = get_strength, set = set_strength



#desc Adds the passed-in [SkeletonModification2D] to the stack.

#desc Deletes the [SkeletonModification2D] at the index position [param mod_idx], if it exists.
func delete_modification(mod_idx: int) -> void:
	pass;

#desc Enables all [SkeletonModification2D]s in the stack.
func enable_all_modifications(enabled: bool) -> void:
	pass;

#desc Executes all of the [SkeletonModification2D]s in the stack that use the same execution mode as the passed-in [param execution_mode], starting from index [code]0[/code] to [member modification_count].
#desc [b]Note:[/b] The order of the modifications can matter depending on the modifications. For example, modifications on a spine should operate before modifications on the arms in order to get proper results.
