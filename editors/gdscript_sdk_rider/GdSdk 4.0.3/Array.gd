#brief A generic array datatype.
#desc A generic array that can contain several elements of any type, accessible by a numerical index starting at 0. Negative indices can be used to count from the back, like in Python (-1 is the last element, -2 is the second to last, etc.).
#desc [b]Example:[/b]
#desc [codeblocks]
#desc [gdscript]
#desc var array = ["One", 2, 3, "Four"]
#desc print(array[0]) # One.
#desc print(array[2]) # 3.
#desc print(array[-1]) # Four.
#desc array[2] = "Three"
#desc print(array[-2]) # Three.
#desc [/gdscript]
#desc [csharp]
#desc var array = new Godot.Collections.Array{"One", 2, 3, "Four"};
#desc GD.Print(array[0]); // One.
#desc GD.Print(array[2]); // 3.
#desc GD.Print(array[array.Count - 1]); // Four.
#desc array[2] = "Three";
#desc GD.Print(array[array.Count - 2]); // Three.
#desc [/csharp]
#desc [/codeblocks]
#desc Arrays can be concatenated using the [code]+[/code] operator:
#desc [codeblocks]
#desc [gdscript]
#desc var array1 = ["One", 2]
#desc var array2 = [3, "Four"]
#desc print(array1 + array2) # ["One", 2, 3, "Four"]
#desc [/gdscript]
#desc [csharp]
#desc // Array concatenation is not possible with C# arrays, but is with Godot.Collections.Array.
#desc var array1 = new Godot.Collections.Array{"One", 2};
#desc var array2 = new Godot.Collections.Array{3, "Four"};
#desc GD.Print(array1 + array2); // Prints [One, 2, 3, Four]
#desc [/csharp]
#desc [/codeblocks]
#desc [b]Note:[/b] Concatenating with the [code]+=[/code] operator will create a new array, which has a cost. If you want to append another array to an existing array, [method append_array] is more efficient.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] Arrays are always passed by reference. To get a copy of an array that can be modified independently of the original array, use [method duplicate].
#desc [b]Note:[/b] Erasing elements while iterating over arrays is [b]not[/b] supported and will result in unpredictable behavior.
