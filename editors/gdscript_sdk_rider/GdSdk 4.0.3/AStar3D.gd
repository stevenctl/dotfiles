extends RefCounted
#brief An implementation of A* to find the shortest paths among connected points in space.
#desc A* (A star) is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal, the process of plotting short paths among vertices (points), passing through a given set of edges (segments). It enjoys widespread use due to its performance and accuracy. Godot's A* implementation uses points in three-dimensional space and Euclidean distances by default.
#desc You must add points manually with [method add_point] and create segments manually with [method connect_points]. Then you can test if there is a path between two points with the [method are_points_connected] function, get a path containing indices by [method get_id_path], or one containing actual coordinates with [method get_point_path].
#desc It is also possible to use non-Euclidean distances. To do so, create a class that extends [code]AStar3D[/code] and override methods [method _compute_cost] and [method _estimate_cost]. Both take two indices and return a length, as is shown in the following example.
#desc [codeblocks]

#desc class MyAStar:
#desc extends AStar3D
#desc 
#desc func _compute_cost(u, v):
#desc return abs(u - v)
#desc 
#desc func _estimate_cost(u, v):
#desc return min(0, abs(u - v) - 1)
#desc [/gdscript]
#desc [csharp]
#desc public partial class MyAStar : AStar3D
#desc {
#desc public override float _ComputeCost(long fromId, long toId)
#desc {
#desc return Mathf.Abs((int)(fromId - toId));
#desc }
#desc 
#desc public override float _EstimateCost(long fromId, long toId)
#desc {
#desc return Mathf.Min(0, Mathf.Abs((int)(fromId - toId)) - 1);
#desc }
#desc }
#desc [/csharp]
#desc [/codeblocks]
#desc [method _estimate_cost] should return a lower bound of the distance, i.e. [code]_estimate_cost(u, v) <= _compute_cost(u, v)[/code]. This serves as a hint to the algorithm because the custom [code]_compute_cost[/code] might be computation-heavy. If this is not the case, make [method _estimate_cost] return the same value as [method _compute_cost] to provide the algorithm with the most accurate information.
#desc If the default [method _estimate_cost] and [method _compute_cost] methods are used, or if the supplied [method _estimate_cost] method returns a lower bound of the cost, then the paths returned by A* will be the lowest-cost paths. Here, the cost of a path equals the sum of the [method _compute_cost] results of all segments in the path multiplied by the [code]weight_scale[/code]s of the endpoints of the respective segments. If the default methods are used and the [code]weight_scale[/code]s of all points are set to [code]1.0[/code], then this equals the sum of Euclidean distances of all segments in the path.

	pass;

#desc Adds a new point at the given position with the given identifier. The [param id] must be 0 or larger, and the [param weight_scale] must be 0.0 or greater.
#desc The [param weight_scale] is multiplied by the result of [method _compute_cost] when determining the overall cost of traveling across a segment from a neighboring point to this point. Thus, all else being equal, the algorithm prefers points with lower [param weight_scale]s to form a path.
