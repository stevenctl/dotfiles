#brief Version Control System (VCS) interface, which reads and writes to the local VCS in use.
#desc Defines the API that the editor uses to extract information from the underlying VCS. The implementation of this API is included in VCS plugins, which are GDExtension plugins that inherit [EditorVCSInterface] and are attached (on demand) to the singleton instance of [EditorVCSInterface]. Instead of performing the task themselves, all the virtual functions listed below are calling the internally overridden functions in the VCS plugins to provide a plug-n-play experience. A custom VCS plugin is supposed to inherit from [EditorVCSInterface] and override each of these virtual functions.
