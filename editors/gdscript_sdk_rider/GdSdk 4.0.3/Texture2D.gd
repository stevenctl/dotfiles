extends Texture
#brief Texture for 2D and 3D.
#desc A texture works by registering an image in the video hardware, which then can be used in 3D models or 2D [Sprite2D] or GUI [Control].
#desc Textures are often created by loading them from a file. See [method @GDScript.load].
#desc [Texture2D] is a base for other resources. It cannot be used directly.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] The maximum texture size is 16384Ã—16384 pixels due to graphics hardware limitations. Larger textures may fail to import.
class_name Texture2D




#desc Called when the entire [Texture2D] is requested to be drawn over a [CanvasItem], with the top-left offset specified in [param pos]. [param modulate] specifies a multiplier for the colors being drawn, while [param transpose] specifies whether drawing should be performed in column-major order instead of row-major order (resulting in 90-degree clockwise rotation).
#desc [b]Note:[/b] This is only used in 2D rendering, not 3D.

#desc Called when a part of the [Texture2D] specified by [param src_rect]'s coordinates is requested to be drawn onto [CanvasItem]'s specified [param rect].
