#brief Scalable texture-based frame that tiles the texture's centers and sides, but keeps the corners' original size. Perfect for panels and dialog boxes.
#desc Also known as 9-slice panels, NinePatchRect produces clean panels of any size, based on a small texture. To do so, it splits the texture in a 3Ã—3 grid. When you scale the node, it tiles the texture's sides horizontally or vertically, the center on both axes but it doesn't scale or tile the corners.

#desc Stretches the center texture across the NinePatchRect. This may cause the texture to be distorted.
#desc Repeats the center texture across the NinePatchRect. This won't cause any visible distortion. The texture must be seamless for this to work without displaying artifacts between edges.
#desc Repeats the center texture across the NinePatchRect, but will also stretch the texture to make sure each tile is visible in full. This may cause the texture to be distorted, but less than [constant AXIS_STRETCH_MODE_STRETCH]. The texture must be seamless for this to work without displaying artifacts between edges.
