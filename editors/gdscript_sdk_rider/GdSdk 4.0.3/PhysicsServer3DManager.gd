#brief Manager for 3D physics server implementations.
#desc [PhysicsServer3DManager] is the API for registering [PhysicsServer3D] implementations, and for setting the default implementation.
#desc [b]Note:[/b] It is not possible to switch physics servers at runtime. This class is only used on startup at the server initialization level, by Godot itself and possibly by GDExtensions.
class_name PhysicsServer3DManager




#desc Register a [PhysicsServer3D] implementation by passing a [param name] and a [Callable] that returns a [PhysicsServer3D] object.
func register_server(name: String, create_callback: Callable) -> void:
	pass;

#desc Set the default [PhysicsServer3D] implementation to the one identified by [param name], if [param priority] is greater than the priority of the current default implementation.
