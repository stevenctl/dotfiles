# TODO

- [] Folding (seems to work.. just need keymaps (dd is broken))
- [] folding not by default
- [] Code runner/tester
- [] fix the shit with comments not getting set correctly
- [] fix TODO highlighting that treesitter broke
- [] indent rulers?
- [] ession/project persistence keeps the same tabs/buffers open (and a special quit)
- [] make sure LSP status is in luabar
- [] make LSP load faster (cache per directory?)

Nice to haves:

- [] use a nicer picker/popup for code actions (maybe just make telescope small)
- [] highlight current word (all instances)
- [] toggleterm?
- [] scrollbars???? mainly for things like Telescope or Trouble
- [] More solid git integration
- [] try out [gruvbox-baby](https://github.com/luisiacc/gruvbox-baby)
