# TODO

- [] Folding
- [] Code runner
  - (we have a tester.. maybe some little snippet manager is better to save envs/flags)
- [] live_grep_args on find files/text when hovering in file tree
- [] fix telescope for ui.select sizing (dressing)
- [] DAP and dap ui

Nice to haves:

- [] "git acitons" (i.e. reset/stage/revert hunk) - we get this as code actions
  - keymap would be good
  - "reset hunk" should be "revert hunk"?
- [] make LSP load faster (cache per directory?) - not slow (yet)
- [] persist open tabs for a project? i.e. "sessions"
- [] fix TODO highlighting that treesitter broke
- [] fix the shit with comments continuation
- [] maybe use code action menu plugin
- [] More solid git integration
- [] indent rulers?
